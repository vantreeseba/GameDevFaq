## Unity

#### Animation
*Bike Pose*

Why does this happen?  
When unity has no ability to set the bone position, it puts the character into this pose with the animator, so check that your animation
is set to humanoid, your rig on the model is also humanoid, and that the animator has an animation clip assigned to the state that is doing this.
